DDK Examples
============

Examples to compile & download onto the DDK boards for hacking around with
the DDKs. These constitute of library-like code + demos

These examples are released under the Juice Sharing License (See LICENSE file
for details).

This directory contains a lot of interesting ready to use examples, along with
the following in capital letters:

+ README - this file
+ LICENSE - project's license file

+ UserManual - User manual of Electronics Device Development Kit (EDDK), as per
	these Examples, for playing with the EDDK, i.e. DDK w/ display. This manual
	is yet a work in progress.

Compiling the Code
==================

+ To compile all the examples relevant for DDK v2.1:

	$ make clean
	$ make

	All the corresponding hex files would be generated.

+ To compile a particular example, say blink_led.hex, for DDK v2.1:

	$ make blink_hex.hex

	All the corresponding hex files would be generated.

+ To compile all the examples relevant for the older DDK v1.1:

	$ make DDK_VER=1.1 clean
	$ make DDK_VER=1.1

	All the corresponding hex files would be generated.

Downloading the Code
====================

+ Get the DDK into bootloader mode. See details below.

+ Then, for downloading a particular example, say blink_led.hex, onto the DDK,
	do the following:

	. For DDK v2.1

		make TARGET=blink_led download

	. For DDK v1.1

		make DDK_VER=1.1 TARGET=blink_led download

		and then shift the BL jumper back to RX jumper

+ Enjoy hacking !!!

Getting DDK into Bootloader mode
================================

+ For DDK v2.1
	1. Connect the DDK to this computer with the USB cable provided along with it.
	2. Switch on the DDK by pressing the power switch on the DDK.
	3. Press the white DOWNLOAD & red RESET buttons together.
	4. First release the RESET, and then the DOWNLOAD button.
	5. If green PGM LED starts blinking, you are in the bootloader mode.
	Otherwise, repeat the above sequence 3 to 5.

+ For earlier DDK v1.1
	1. Connect the DDK to this computer with the USB cable provided along with it.
	2. Shift the RX jumper to BL jumper & then press the red RESET button.
	3. Now, you most probably are in the bootloader mode.
	Otherwise, power off / disconnect the DDK, and power / connect it again, and
	you should be in the bootloader mode.
